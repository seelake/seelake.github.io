      <h2>Controlling with iPad (Wi-Fi)</h2> Beside using a LiveControl, monitor, keyboard and mouse, AudioStation can be controlled via Wi-Fi with an iPad as well. To be operative everywhere even without Internet connection, Wi-Fi signal is generated from AudioStation without the need for a computer or any additional hardware.
