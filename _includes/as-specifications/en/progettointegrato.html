      <h2>Integrated project</h2>
      <p>AudioStation is not only just an assemblage of some items, but an integrated project where hardware and software have been built to interact at the best.</p>
      <p>It includes anything useful in every situation:</p>
      <ul>
          <li> Powerful processor</li>
          <li> Large RAM memory</li>
          <li> 1 or 2 large hard disks</li>
          <li> DVD writer</li>
          <li> Main Operative System expressely built and optimized for audio signals processing, based on Microsoft Windows 7 64-bit kernel and compatible with any 64-bit plugin and music software written for Windows 7. With the integration of a 32-bit to 64-bit bridge, 32-bit plugins can be also used, including older versions running on Windows XP.</li>
          <li> AudioStation software Audio and VST Mixer-Host integrated in the operative system.</li>
          <li> Completely independent additional operative environment, to use AudioStation like a traditional computer for word processing, graphics, web or any other, with no risk to the AudioStation audio/musical functionality. </li>
          <li> operative environment for the maintenance of the device, where users can: restore factory defaults; clone installations into the (optional) backup hard disk and vice versa; wipe the file system in case of shocks or free falls</li>
          <li> Audio system with many I/Os and high quality converters</li>
          <li> MIDI system with many I/Os and ultra precise timing</li>
          <li> Live Control remote controller for controlling AudioStation in live performances with no need for monitor, keyboard nor mouse</li>
          <li>Remotely controlled and programmed also from iPad via WiFi (the WiFi signal is generated from AudioStation - no Internet connection or extra hardware needed).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>In this way only we could obtain a powerful digital audio portable workstation computer-based, really stable and reliable to be used with no hassle also in live performances.</strong></p>
