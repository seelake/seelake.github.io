        <h2>Audio and MIDI connectivity   </h2>
        <p>Multiple audio inputs and outputs allow to simultaneously record on separated tracks many instruments or voices, and - even - a whole acoustic drum.</p>
        <p> Through the MIDI I/Os you can connect one or more master keyboard and many other external MIDI devices that you can use in your projects.</p>
