            TheÂ mixing console also embeds an useful and practical digital audio player/recorder with which to playback multitrack or stereo backing tracks and record performance, together with software instruments and effects.
            <br> The player/recorder allows to:
            <ul>
                <li> Playback (in loop too) grooves or backing tracks wihout length limits, with up to 24 mono or stereo tracks, in MP3 format or 16, 24 or 32-bit WAV with sample rate up to 96KHz. MP3 and WAV tracks can be simultaneously reproduced in perfect sync, even if they have different samplerates. The tracks can also be synchronized with grooves or sequences generated from plugins activated in the console, of from external instruments MIDI-synchronized with AudioStation.</li>
                <li> Adjust volume, panpot and mute of every track</li>
                <li> Route the tracks to the console stereo channel dedicated to the player or to independent audio outputs</li>
                <li> Apply VST effects and automatic fadeout to the tracks mix</li>
                <li> Choose a song while another one is playing</li>
                <li> Automatically synchronize the VST effects tempo to the backing track BPM</li>
                <li> Generate the proper audio/MIDI click for every song</li>
                <li> Stereophonically record the Master output, including any backing track.</li>
            </ul>
