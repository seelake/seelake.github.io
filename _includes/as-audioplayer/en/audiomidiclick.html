        <h2>Audio and MIDI Click</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The Player/Recorder section includes a handy audio/MIDI click generator, useful to play in time with songs, but also with grooves and sequences generated by plugins or external MIDI devices synchronized with AudioStation. Of course, it can be used to record too, or simply to play in time without a backing song.
                <br> Audio and MIDI click can be run at the sime time. In particular:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Audio click is generated internally when Play button gets pressed and can be freely routed to one or more audio outputs, also together with the backing track or other signals coming from the mixing console</li>
                <li> MIDI click too is generated when Play button is pressed, and outputs MIDI notes that can be addressed to an external sound generator, on a MIDI output and a MIDI channel of user&rsquo;s choice.</li>
            </ul>
           </div>

            <img src="../images/audply_audiomidiclick.png" width="251" height="240" class="img-responsive center-block"> <p>For both you can adjust pitch and volume of the first and the following clicks in measure, separately. These settings are saved in the patches of the player-dedicated channel and/or in the performances (the scenes of the whole console). This way every song and every setup have their proper settings.</p>
