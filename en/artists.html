                Ever Forthright is a progressive metal band from one of the most musically diverse places in the world: New York City. Artfully fusing modern jazz, progressive metal, hip-hop, electronica, and other styles of music into an auditory landscape is one of the reasons why Ever Forthright are quickly becoming known as true architects of modern music.
                <span class="collapse readmore" id="collapse_ev">Most of the members have attended and/or graduated from some of the top jazz performance schools in the world.
            <p>Ever Forthright is a 6 piece band that simultaneously use the Seelake Audiostation for live performances.
                   <br> It runs the multiple VST's and plug-ins for guitars, bass, keyboards, and bass drum trigger. The Audiostation even changes these patches automatically so the band can strictly focus on their performance.
                   <br> They also use it as a digital mixer to provide everyone in the band his own, easily customizable IEM mix.</p>
                   <p>Since everything runs through the Seelake Audiostation, they record live performances with the push of a single button to listen back to later in perfect quality. These recordings can be used to easily make media of their live performances.</p>
