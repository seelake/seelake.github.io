        <h2>Powerful portable VST-player and audio computer for live and the studio</h2>

        <p>AudioStation X64 is a portable 2U rack computer-based audio workstation, suitable in many situations, such as live performances, rehearsal room, FOH and in the studio.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a powerful CPU, 2 HDD/SSD storage unities, a large RAM memory, multiple audio and MIDI inputs and outputs, a 64-bit operative system especially built and tailored for real-time audio signals processing and a high-efficiency hybrid cooling system that allows you to play in any conditions, AudioStation X64 can be used with any audio application everywhere.</p>
        <p>The integration of Jack Audio Server and an advanced remote control system enable AudioStation X64 to run multiple audio applications and be controlled / programmed via Wi-Fi with an iPad. As an option, a dedicated hardware controller is also available.</p>
        <p>AudioStation X64 also supports the MIDI Over Wi-Fi Network protocol. So you can use an iPhone/iPad as wireless MIDI controller to play plugins in real time or control a DAW software.</p>

            <h3>Rehearsal room</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Many bands have an hard time finding an acoustically insulated space to play without bothering the neighbors. Main noise sources are avoided by using percussive pads with drum samples and guitar and bass amplifier simulators: hence a whole band can play everywhere, even in a house. </p>

        <p>You simply install your favourite software, such as Pro Tools, Cubase, Nuendo, Sonar, Wavelab, Sound Forge, Live or other, with no need for further external hardware devices.</p>
        <p> Thus you don&rsquo;t need to buy a device for live performances and a computer for the recording studio. With a single versatile device you can fulfill both needs.</p>
